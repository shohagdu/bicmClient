						<p style="Text-align: justify;   font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">
                             JFMG has adopted the ‘Your Paper Your Way’ policy in order to facilitate hassle-free and easy submissions of scholarly works. It means there is no mandatory requirement of applying any specific formatting style and supplying figures separately. <br/><br/>
                               During the first submission, authors need to submit their manuscripts as single MS Word or PDF files, including all figures, figure legends, and references. Of course, all papers need to include the generic elements that are applicable to the particular article type; such as title, abstract, introduction, materials & methods, results, discussion (or results and discussion combined), conclusion, references, and figures.  You can use any referencing style for initial submissions.<br/><br/>
                               Only when your paper is at the revision stage and you are asked to submit a revision in response to reviews, you will be requested to transform your paper into the 'correct format' for acceptance and provide the items necessary for your article’s final publication.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <b>Initial Submissions </b><br/>
                                Upload your manuscript files all-inclusive of title page, main document, references, figures, and tables. Supplementary files can be uploaded separately. Documents should be prepared in MS Word or Latex and should be submitted in MS Word or PDF version. <br/><br/>
                               In the submission system, for reviewing purposes, you should upload a single .pdf for the main manuscript that you have generated from your source files. You must use the File Designation "Main Document" from the dropdown box. You should also submit a Title Page separately which will contain Author name, affiliation and contact details. You can then upload the supplementary files using the “Supplementary Files” File Designation from the dropdown box.  <br/><br/>
                                <b>Revised Submissions </b><br/>
                                Original and Editable source files must be uploaded at this stage. Tables must be on separate pages after the reference list, and not be incorporated into the main text. Figures should be uploaded as separate figure files in JPEG or TIFF format.   <br/>
                               <br/> For Latex users, in addition you must upload your TeX source files. For all your source files you must use the File Designation "Supplemental Material not for review".  <br/><br/>
                                During revised submission, previous versions of uploaded documents must be deleted. If your manuscript is accepted for publication, we will use the files you upload to typeset your article within a totally digital workflow. <br/>

                            Parts of the Manuscript For first submission, the manuscript should be submitted in separate files: (1) title page and (2) main text file including figures, tables, and references. The first title page should contain: the article title, author name, affiliation, contact details, any and acknowledgements pertaining to the work. The main document should contain title, abstract, keywords, JEL classifications, acknowledgement, declarations, and the main content of the article. The main content generally should include Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Analysis/Discussion or both together, references, and appendices. Supplementary files can be submitted separately in the submission system.<br/><br/>
                            Upload both as separate documents, under file designation ‘Title Page’ and ‘Main Document’. The present address of any author, if different from where the work was carried out, should be supplied in a footnote. <br/><br/>
