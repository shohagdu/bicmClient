The study objective section should be more specific: making the research objective more crystal clear in a single or two research questions instead of four questions.\r\n\r\n2.	The study cites literature on interdependence of stock market across the countries. However, the study focuses on the dual listing of stocks in two exchanges (DSE and CSE) in the same country. As both stock exchanges have same securities, so both stock exchanges are driven by same-company specific fundamentals. It might be better if study cites literature on dual listing of securities and stock exchanges that contain same securities listed. For example, literature on interdependence between Shanghai stock exchange and Shenzen stock exchange in China and between BSE and national stock exchange in India. \r\n\r\n3.	The study uses DSE30 and CSE30 from 2014 to 2020, February. However, DSE30 and CSE30 represent less than 50% of the market. As the study objective and conclusion is about the whole market, it might be better if the study tests the broad index of DSE and CSE- DSEX and CSE All share price index that represent more than 95% of the market capitalization and test if the results sustain when broader proxies of the market are considered. Moreover, study does not discuss why they have taken 2014 to 2020 as the time period of study. Would the result be valid if longer-period data is taken or time interval is changed? In order for the result to be robust, the study should address those concerns.\r\n\r\n4.	The study reports that stock prices in DSE markets can influence the stock prices in CSE market in the short run but not the other way around and there is no-long run interdependce. However, the study does not give any possible reasons why shock in DSE is transmitted to CSE but not the other way around and why there is no long-run interdependence despite the both stock exchanges contains the similar securities listed. It would be helpful if the study had provided probable reasons for the above mentioned results. \r\n\r\n5.	There are several typos and grammatical errors. The paper needs to go through thorough copy-edit and language improvement.\r\n\r\nFinally, the study could be published if the above-mentioned concerns are duly addressed.\r\n', 1, '2021-06-10 05:06:21'),

Originality of idea: Does the paper contain new information and significant knowledge contribution that justifies its publication?\r\nThis paper attempts to reveal the causation between govt revenue and expenditure considering the Vector Autoregressive approach resembling simultaneous equation modelling which is quite eminent when we deal with endogenous variables together. Hence the idea of this paper is consistent and contains new information justifying the publication.\r\n\r\n2. Contextualizing the Literature: Does the manuscript evidence a comprehensive understanding of the relevant literature in the field? Does it cite the appropriate and significant works? Has (have) any significant work(s) been ignored?\r\nThis paper covers sufficient reviews of the literature relevant to the topic.\r\n\r\n3. Methodology: Is the methodology of the paper appropriately designed? Does the paper build on any theories, concepts or defined frameworks? Does it offer any new theories, concepts or frameworks that can be tested further? Are the methods and techniques used appropriate and relevant for the work? Have the methods and techniques implemented appropriately?\r\nThe methodology of this paper should include the mathematical models of VAR using equation along with proper justification for implementing these models. In Addition, the author may also incorporate the use of these VAR models to predict the govt expenditure being a dependent variable as govt revenue affects its expenditure.\r\n\r\n4. Results and discussions: Does the paper report results with clarity? Does it interpret the results appropriately and adequately with support from the relevant literature? Do the conclusions align with the other elements of the paper, e.g., research objectives, results and discussions?\r\nThe output estimated from VAR models considering three lags of each variable shows that none of the lags of expenditure is statistically significant in affecting govt revenue whereas in the second model the lags of govt revue are statistically significant at the chosen level of significance in affecting its expenditure. So, itâ€™s obvious to infer that govt expenditure depends on its revenue which is found consistent as per granger causality test. Surprisingly, in the last sentence of the abstract, the author has mentioned the opposite findings of causation between government revenue and its expenditure that he has discovered in the analysis segment.\r\n\r\n5. Research implications: Does the paper suggest any academic, professional, public and/or social policy formulation? Does the paper provide any direction as to how the research could help in further knowledge and practice in the broad areas of finance?\r\nUnfortunately, this section remains unexplored by the author/s. There is hardly found any policy implication of the findings contributed from this paper. Therefore, the respective author is requested to incorporate some policy implications of these findings, especially in determining Govt revenue accelerating its expenditure.\r\n\r\n6. Standard of communication: Is the paperâ€™s expression readable and up to the international standard, such as sentence structure, jargon use, acronyms, etc.?\r\nDoes the paper describe in language that is understandable to general readers in business, finance and economics?\r\nDoes the paper uses abbreviations and elaborates on them appropriately?\r\nWhat is the quality of the English language used in the paper?\r\nThe language of the paper is user friendly and up to the international standard.\r\n\r\nRecommendation\r\nMinor revision\r\n\r\nDEAR AUTHOR,\r\nPLEASE REVISE THE MANUSCRIPT ACCORDING TO THE SUGGESTIONS ABOVE AND RESUBMIT BY 25 JUNE 2021. \r\nALONGSIDE THE REVISED MANUSCRIPT, PLEASE SUBMIT A STATEMENT EXPLAINING POINT-BY-POINT YOUR RESPONSES TO EACH OF THE COMMENTS ABOVE.\r\n\r\nSUBORNA BARUA, PHD\r\nMANAGING EDITOR', 1, '2021-06-14 05:33:47'),

Abstract is not written properly. It should not include the list of independent variables in the first place. The findings should be moved earlier and not in line 10. \r\n2. Introduction section seems incomplete. Please briefly include the motivation of your study â€“ why such study is required, what is your findings, and what is your specific contribution to the literature. The author(s) should clearly mention why they select P/E ratio to measure stock market performance and why not any other indicators (such as annualized stock returns or abnormal returns). The paper should also include a short discussion on why the author(s) use a sample of commercial banks to test their hypothesis and why they have not used non-financial firms. \r\n3. The hypothesis section is also underdeveloped. The research gap and motivation is not properly identified. Even though the section mentions about 3 hypotheses, but actually reports 2. Hypothesis 1 should be re-written to reflect the core idea of the research. There is no preceding discussion on the prediction of Hypothesis 2. \r\n4. Among 30 listed commercial banks, only 7 are selected in the sample. Author(s) should either increase the sample size or provide a strong justification on why these 7 banks could be representatives of the banking sector in Bangladesh. \r\n5. One big concern in the empirical setup of this study is the mechanical relation between the dependent variable and some of the financial performance indicating variables. Author(s) should clarify why the dependent and key independent variables are not endogenously related given that both have an earnings component included in the calculation. \r\n6. Conclusion should be clearly written to reflect the policy implication of the findings â€“ how the findings of this study could be useful for the investors, bank managers, regulators, and analysts. \r\n7. I would like to see a comparison of the economic significance of the statistically significant variables in Table 4 and Table 12. \r\n8. Author(s) need to spend a fair amount of time on proofreading. There are a few typos. Section headings should be carefully checked (for example, 4.3. (sic) Research variables).\r\n9. Please check for similarity index using Turnitin or other software and revise accordingly.\r\n\r\nDecision: Minor Revision', 1, '2021-06-30 06:06:48'),
(6, 'JFMG-202103-00002', '4', 3, 'Journal of Financial Markets and Governance\r\nReferee report for Manuscript: JFMG-202103-00002\r\nImpact of Dividend Policy on Stock Price Volatility: An Empirical Study on Financial Service Industry of Bangladesh\r\n\r\n- Main idea\r\nThis paper examines the relationship between stock price volatility and dividend policy for firms in the financial service industry in Bangladesh. The authors find a significant positive relationship between stock price volatility and dividend yield.\r\n\r\n- Report overview\r\nOverall, I find that the research question is intriguing. However, I have major concerns regarding the hypothesis and choice of the primary research design. I discuss these and other comments in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n- Abstract\r\nThe abstract of the paper contains excessive text. Abstract should represent the core aspects of the manuscript. I suggest the authors to revise the abstract. You should include the main objectives, findings and implication in a simple and concise way.\r\nIntroduction\r\nâ€¢ Introduction section of the paper is not well-structured. I suggest the authors to start this section with the main objective of the study. This section contains a lot of repetitive statements. The authors need to read this section carefully to reduce the repetition and ensure a smooth flow.\r\nâ€¢ The authors currently use very complex sentence structure. Some of the sentences are very long and the intended message is unclear. For example, on p. 1 the authors mentioned that:\r\no Paramount significance on defining the appropriate dividend policy of a corporation has been becoming integral issue progressively, firstly in the context of the constant importance on maximizing the wealth of the shareholders and, secondly on the because market associates may have diverse preferences and opinion of market associates regarding the appropriate dividend policy.\r\nThis is an example of long sentence; there are several similar sentences. Overall, the authors need to substantially improve the readability of the paper.\r\nâ€¢ On p. 2, the authors noted that, â€œOn the other hand, stock price volatility is the systemic risk encountered by the investors who hold common stock (Guo, 2002)â€. I am not sure if this statement is true. In essence, stock price volatility has both ideocratic and systematic components. The authors need to check the original paper to clarify this.\r\nâ€¢ I donâ€™t see the hypothesis in the introduction section. The authors need to briefly explain the expected relationship between dividend policy and stock price volatility and the rationale for such relationship. Introduction section also lacks the discussion on the contribution of the study. I encourage the authors to go through a few papers published in top-tier journals to improve the overall write-up. If access to the journals is not available, authors can download the similar papers (accepted version) from SSRN/ResearchGate.\r\nâ€¢ The authors have complete freedom to decide the layout of the manuscript for introduction section. If needed, they can follow the structure given below:\r\n\r\n- Objective + Motivation (why this study is interesting) + Brief discussion on prior studies + Hypothesis + Findings + Contribution.\r\nLiterature review and theories of dividend policy\r\nâ€¢ Currently there are two separate sections for literature review and theories of dividend policy. This is truly unnecessary. I suggest the authors to merge both sections. You do not need to explain all the dividend theories; just focus on the theories that are relevant for your study.\r\nâ€¢ The literature review is excessive and lack coherence. Please include the relevant literature only.\r\nâ€¢ Importantly and interestingly, there is no hypothesis in the paper. Based on the prior literature and dividend theories, the authors need to come up with a hypothesis. There should be clear arguments for the hypothesis to be used in the paper.\r\n\r\n- Objective of the study\r\nI donâ€™t see any logic for a section on the objective of the study, especially in the middle of the manuscript. I suggest the authors to include this very briefly in the introduction section of the study.\r\n\r\n- Data source and sample\r\nThis section has a lot of repetitions. I am not sure why standard deviation of stock return is not used to measure stock price volatility. The authors mentioned that standard deviation could be affected by extreme values. However, winsorization can solve this problem.\r\n\r\n- Research methodology\r\nâ€¢ Not sure why hypotheses are reported under research methodology section!\r\nâ€¢ Discussion on diagnostic test and different data analysis technique consumes valuable space without adding any value. Diagnostic test results can go to the footnote and other discussion on various regression technique can be completely deleted.\r\n\r\n- Correlation matrix\r\nCorrelation matrix should include significance level for each coefficient.\r\n\r\n- Model specification\r\nâ€¢ I am not sure about the model specification and regression models used in the study. You just need to include the controls that prior studies suggest affecting stock price volatility. There is standard literature on this.\r\nâ€¢ Why do you need to do trial and error to find a model fit?\r\nâ€¢ The authors use Hausman specification test. This test should guide the authors to find the appropriate regression model; just use this and show results from a few techniques in the sensitivity analysis. Results and discussion on Table 6-8 can be complete eliminated.\r\nâ€¢ Overall, I find the analysis section very confusing. As discussed earlier, show the results from one standard model, discuss the results very clearly and you may show some sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the robustness of the findings.\r\n\r\n- Conclusion\r\nThe authors need to go through his section to improve the readability and flow.\r\n\r\nOverall, in my opinion, the authors need to do a major revision to improve the paper. My objective for a detailed review is to improve the quality of the manuscript and help the authors to work for a quality publication. Wish you all the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall  decision: Major revision', 1, '2021-07-04 11:56:12'),

In Bangladesh, an efficient bond market can play a vital role in supplementing the banking system to meet the requirements of the corporate sector for long-term capital investment and asset creation while providing a steady source of finance in case of equity market volatility. The study has explored the prospects and challenges of the bond market in Bangladesh using secondary data from abundant sources. The study has addressed that the amount of tradable government bonds is negligible, secondary trading of government bonds is infrequent, and there has been scarcely any public issue of corporate bonds. It is observed that the bond market remains mostly underdeveloped to finance the large infrastructural projects in our country. The study has also compared the bond market of Bangladesh with twelve Asian nations and revealed that our bond market appears to be very insignificant in terms of the size and the corporate bond to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio relative to those of countries. There are a plethora of impediments to the expansion of the bond market in Bangladesh, which have been attributed to major structural issues such as low investor base, absence of benchmark yield curve, lack of investor awareness and high issuance cost. For the smooth operation of a deep and liquid bond market in Bangladesh, a comprehensive regulatory framework, bond investment-friendly administrative infrastructures, and augmented investor incentives are recommended. It is a message of optimism that the regulatory authority has already taken initiatives to introduce several bonds with various features to make the capital market more vibrant.', 'Bond Market; Issuer; Investor; Policymaker and Capital Market.', 8, '2021-06-23 15:45:38', 4, 4, 0, 0),

This study investigates the relationship between stock price volatility and dividend policy among the companies of the financial service industry in Bangladesh. The study considers commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) as the major participants of the financial service industry in Bangladesh. Companies of these industries that are listed in the primary bourse of the country are considered and the overall data analyzed constitute around 65% of market capitalization of the industries. It is observed that in the recent years the companies of these industries are paying regular cash dividends to the stockholders and hence the need to investigate the impact of dividend policy on stock price volatility. Panel regression analysis is used, and the study finds significant positive relationship between stock price volatility and dividend yield, one of the proxies of dividend policy, among companies considered in the study. This study will provide significant insight to the policymakers of financial service industry of Bangladesh especially in the banks and NBFIs to better understand the impact of dividend policy on stock price volatility and to formulate dividend policy strategies.', 'Dividend Policy; Corporate Finance; Financial Service Industry; Price Volatility.', 8, '2021-07-04 11:57:29', 0, 10, 0, 0),

The CSE market quickly response to the shock in DSE market, however, the DSE market is not responsive to the CSE market.

(5, 'JFMG-202103-00005', 'A Random walk down DSE (the Dhaka Stock Exchange) lane?', 'Market efficiency has always been a matter of keen interest to researchers. Since the advancement of this concept, researchers have been consistently investigating the market efficiency of different financial markets. Bangladesh, being one of the brightest emerging economies, had also attracted the attention of many researchers. Most of their investigations revealed that both stock exchanges of the country, the Dhaka and the Chittagong stock exchange, are inefficient. However, most of the prior research works related to the Bangladesh market did not corroborate findings of the parametric tests with the non-parametric ones and vice versa. Therefore, validity of their works can be questioned. Moreover, prior efficiency researches related to the Bangladeshi stock markets did not test the presence of long memory of the return series. This research work revisited the market efficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Limited (DSE), cross-verified the findings of the parametric tests with the non-parametric ones, and also tested long memory of the return series offering knowledge that fills the void mentioned above. The findings of the parametric and the non-parametric tests (the run test, the ADF test, the KPSS test, and the K-S test) suggest that the return series of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Limited (the major Stock Exchange of the country) is time series stationary, non-normal, and do not follow a random walk. Results of the ARFIMA model confirm that the long memory parameter, â€˜dâ€™, is insignificant. Therefore, the return series does not follow a long memory process. Given these results, we must echo the prior researchers to conclude that the stock market of Bangladesh is not efficient for 2015-2020. Moreover, any shock in the market, such as a crash, is not retained in the memory of the system for long and eventually disappears. These findings add new knowledge to the existing knowledge pool about market efficiency and long memory of the Bangladeshi stock market.', 'Random Walk; long memory; ARFIMA test; Run test; ADF test; KPSS test; K-S test; Dhaka Stock Exchange; 2015 â€“ 2020', 12, '2021-07-08 17:38:17', 10, 10, 0, 0),

To conduct the study, secondary data sources have been primarily used. Some information was also collected from official over the phone. The study was based on five consecutive years i.e. 2015 to 2019. At first, the background of the study and the importance of investment management have been described. In the subsequent part, Data collection methodology, research design, tools and technique have been depicted. The major findings are that both the amount of total deposit and investment has increased over the periods, however, the growth rate of both deposit and investment experienced fluctuations. The ratio of investment deposit also remains as high as 90%. The bank invests in more than 10 different modes. The bank invests more in Murabaha, Bai-Muazzal, HPSM and Quard.

To measure the efficiency of the bank in managing investment, Different aspects (i.e. amount, ratio, profit and growth) of deposit, investment, investment modes and procedures are scrutinized thoroughly. To conduct the study, secondary data sources have been primarily used. Some information was also collected from officials over the phone. The study was based on five consecutive years i.e. 2015 to 2019. At first, the background of the study and the importance of investment management have been described. In the subsequent part, Data collection methodology, research design, tools and technique have been depicted. The major findings are that both the amount of total deposit and investment has increased over the periods, however, the growth rate of both deposit and investment experienced fluctuations. The ratio of investment deposit also remains as high as 90%. The bank invests in more than 10 different modes. The bank invests more in Murabaha, Bai-Muazzal, HPSM and Quard.

The independent variables are: Liquidity ratio, Leverage ratio, Net Profit Margin ratio, Net Interest Margin, Asset Utilization Ratio, Loans to Asset and NPL Ratio. Several hypotheses have been developed and econometric models such as the Pooled OLS, GLS, Fixed-effect, Random-effect, and finally, One-step GMM model have been applied accordingly. Various diagnostic tests have also been adopted, such as model specification test, test of heteroskedasticity, cross-sectional dependence test, test of autocorrelation, test of multicollinearity and unit root test to examine the validity of the models selected for this investigation. The empirical investigation shows that, among the entire set of variables only NPM ratio has significant impact on the P/E ratio under Random-effect, GLS and Pooled-OLS. Finally, the model developed for One-step GMM method adopted one year lagged value of PE as independent variable and showed that, including lagged PE value, the Leverage, P/E ratio, NPM, NIM ratio, Asset Utilization Ratio, and NPL ratio have statistically significant dynamic impact on the Price-earnings ratios of the commercial banks.

It examines Panel Data of 10 years covering from 2010 to 2019 of seven Private Commercial Banks (PCBs) of Bangladesh enlisted in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Several hypotheses and econometric models have been estimated with the Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (Pooled OLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS), Fixed-eï¬€ect, and Random-eï¬€ect, followed by various diagnostic tests to examine the validity of the models selected for this study. Finally, the One-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) method has been adopted. The empirical investigation shows that among the entire set of the variables, only the Net Proï¬t Margin (NPM) ratio has a signiï¬cant impact on the P/E ratio under Random-eï¬€ect, GLS, and Pooled OLS. Finally, the model developed for the One-step GMM method has revealed that the inclusion of the Lagged P/E ratio, Leverage, NPM ratio, Net Interest Margin (NIM) ratio, Asset Utilization Ratio, and Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio have a statistically signiï¬cant dynamic impact on the P/E ratios of the PCBs. However, the Liquidity ratio and the Loans to Asset ratio divulged no statistical signiï¬cance under any of the estimated models.', '', '', '', '61cb3b3e9341fLalonandMahmud.pdf', '2022-06-13 05:19:12', 1, 'Original Research Article'),

Since the advancement of this concept, researchers are consistently investigating the market eï¬ƒciency of diï¬€erent ï¬nancial markets. Bangladesh, being one of the emerging economies, has also attracted the attention of many researchers. The researchers have investigated the realities regarding the market eï¬ƒciency of both the stock exchanges of the country. Most of their investigations reveal that the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) are ineï¬ƒcient. This research, however, did not stop at revisiting market eï¬ƒciency alone. Whether the return series follows a long-memory process, has also been tested. Besides, non-parametric tests have also been conducted to conï¬rm the results of the parametric tests and vice versa. It generated a more reliable estimate of market eï¬ƒciency for the period under study. Results of the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model conï¬rm that the return series does not follow a long memory process, and any shock in the system will eventually vanish. The ï¬ndings of other tests (the run test, the Augmented Dickey&amp;ndash;Fuller (ADF) test, the Kwiatkowski&amp;ndash;Phillips&amp;ndash;Schmidt&amp;ndash;Shin (KPSS) test, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test) suggest that the return series of the DSE are time-series stationary, non-normal, and do not follow a random walk. Given these results, we must echo the prior researchers to conclude that the stock market of Bangladesh is not eï¬ƒcient for the period of 2015 to 2020. These ï¬ndings add new knowledge to the existing knowledge pool about market eï¬ƒciency and long memory of the stock market of Bangladesh. &amp;nbsp;', '', '', '', '61cb537980e47Bari, Mehjabeen and Haque (2021).pdf', '2022-01-02 10:22:20', 1, 'Original Research Article'),

The CSE market quickly responds to the shock in the DSE market. But, the DSE market is not responsive to the CSE market. The variance decomposition analysis shows that most of the shocks in the CSE market are explained by its own market.

In Addition, the author may also incorporate the use of these VAR models to predict the govt expenditure being a dependent variable as govt revenue affects its expenditure.', 'The output estimated from VAR models considering three lags of each variable shows that none of the lags of expenditure is statistically significant in affecting  govt revenue whereas in the second model the lags of govt revue are statistically significant at chosen level of significance in affecting its expenditure. So, itâ€™s obvious to infer that govt expenditure depends on its revenue which is found consistent as per granger causality test. \r\nSurprisingly, in the last sentence of abstract, the author has mentioned the opposite findings of causation between govt revenue and its expenditure that he has discovered in analysis segment.

The findings should be moved earlier and not in the line 10.\r\n2.	Introduction section seems incomplete. Please briefly include motivation of your study â€“ why such study is required, what is your findings, and what is your specific contribution to the literature. The author(s) should clearly mention why they select P/E ratio to measure stock market performance and why not any other indicators (such as annualized stock returns or abnormal returns). The paper should also include a short discussion on why author(s) use a sample of commercial banks to test their hypothesis and why they have not used non-financial firms.  \r\n3.	The hypothesis section is also underdeveloped. The research gap and motivation is not properly identified. Even though the section mentions about 3 hypotheses, but actually reports 2. Hypothesis 1 should be re-written to reflect the core idea of the research. There is no preceding discussion on the prediction of Hypothesis 2.\r\n4.	Among 30 listed commercial banks, only 7 are selected in the sample. Author(s) should either increase the sample size or provide a strong justification on why these 7 banks could be representatives of the banking sector in Bangladesh.\r\n5.	One big concern on the empirical setup of this study is the mechanical relation between the dependent variable and some of the financial performance indicating variables. Author(s) should clarify why the dependent and key independent variables are not endogenously related given that both have an earnings component included in the calculation.\r\n6.	Conclusion should be clearly written to reflect the policy implication of the findings â€“ how the findings of this study could be useful for the investors, bank managers, regulators, and analysts.\r\n7.	I would like to see a comparison of the economic significance of the statistically significant variables in Table 4 and Table 12.      \r\n8.	Author(s) need to spend a fair amount of time on proofreading. There are a few typos. Section headings should be carefully checked (for example, 4.3. (sic) Research variables).

Hypotheses are presented in section 2.7 and are not linked to the literature review. Hypotheses should be a part of the literature review section, not a separate subsection. The studies should be organized in such a way that the discussion of literature leads to the hypothesis. \r\nii.	It seems to me that the authors paid much attention to the methods used in earlier studies and how findings are different or what are the shortcomings of those papers in terms of methods. In my opinion, the authors should not be too elaborative of the methods used by each of prior studies discussed in the literature review section. \r\niii.	I would recommend that instead of grouping literature review into three sections by origin of the paper (i.e., country), the authors present the review in one section. In other words, I do not recommend using sub-sections in the literature review section.\r\niv.	I highly recommend presenting section 2.3 (literature review on Bangladesh stock markets) as paragraphs instead of 7-page long table. Each paper discussed in this section could be summarized in 1 or 2 sentences. Discussion of criticism for each paper is excessive. Rather, all criticisms could be grouped/summarized into one paragraph. Discussion on the column on â€œmodels usedâ€ should be dropped.\r\n', 'The methods are appropriate and relevant for the work.', 'i.	Introduction section should be able to give a brief overview of the paper. In other words, introduction section should give some brief idea about motivation, objective, hypothesis, data, methods, and findings. The authors nicely provide some idea about motivation and research questions. However, it lacks any overview on the other necessary elements such as methods, findings etc. I also recommend dropping the first paragraph of introduction since this paragraph seems to be too elementary to be included in an academic journal.\r\nii.	Instead of presenting results in section 4 and discussions in section 5 separately, the authors should combine them into one section such that the discussion follows the result for each table.', 'The authors should put more effort in explaining why investors and traders care about whether the market has long memory or whether the market is not weak-form efficient. I think this paper lacks the implications of the findings. The authors should present the implications of the findings that: the market is not weak-form efficient; return series is time series stationary; return data are non-normal, return data do not follow a long memory process. ', 'i.	The paper has frequent uses of expressions, e.g., â€œit is needless to say thatâ€, â€œit can be said thatâ€, â€œit is to beâ€ etc. for better readability, I would recommend avoiding these unnecessary wordings in the revised manuscript.\r\nii.	The quality of English language used in the paper is acceptable. Abbreviations are appropriately elaborated. However, abstract is too long. I recommend cutting it short by around 50%. One suggestion is that abstract can start where it says â€œThis research work revisited the market efficiency of â€¦..â€. Just a suggestion.\r\niii.	For better understandability and for conformity with the writing structure of renowned international finance and economics journals, I recommend that the authors consider re-writing the paper in present tense. Besides, they can consider using more active voice rather than passive voice, whenever appropriate.\r\niv.	I think that introduction section does not need to have a sub-section.\r\nv.	For better comprehension, the authors should use more paragraph breaks in the discussion (particulary, on page 4, 5, and 7).', '3', 'I think the paper is not publishable in its current form.

The author is requested to go through a comprehensive review on panel data econometrics before construction of the methodology of this paper.
